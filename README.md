## Overview

This is my solution to the challenge. You can view the site on the live url.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

I first design the form and its active states and the mobile version with figma making the styling straightforward and easier. After use some javascript to throw errors on user inputs.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- BEM convention for naming classes


### What I learned

Completing this challenge, I wanted to learn about customizing client side validation forms. Unfortunately still not perfect. I will find a way to do it better. 


### Continued development

I want to learn more about client side validation forms and master this topic.
